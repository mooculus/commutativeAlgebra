\section{The ideal membership problem}

Given a ring and ideal in the ring, we would like to know when an
element is a member of the ideal. We'll need some notation.


\begin{definition}
  Consider a polynomial $F\in k[x_1,\dots, x_n]$ with a monomial order
  $>$.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The \dfn{multidegree} of $F$ is
    \[
    \multideg(F) := \max\{\valpha: \text{$c_\valpha x^\valpha$ is the largest term w.r.t.\ $>$} \}.
    \]
  \item The \dfn{lead coefficient} of $F$ is $\lc(F) := c_{\multideg(F)}$.
  \item The \dfn{lead monomial} of $F$ is $\lm(F) := \x^{\multideg(F)}$.
  \item The \dfn{lead term} of $F$ is $\lt(F) := \lc(F)\cdot \lm(F)$.
  \item The \dfn{ideal of lead terms} of an ideal $I\subset k[\x]$ is
    the ideal
    \[
    \lt(I) = (\lt(F): F\in I)\subset k[\x].
    \]
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Now suppose we are working in the ring $k[x_1,\dots, x_n]$ and we have an ideal
\[
I = (G_1,\dots, G_m) \subset k[\x].
\]
Here is a basic algorithm that attempts to solve the ideal membership
problem.

\begin{algorithm}[Division algorithm]
  \hfill
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Procedure{Division}{$F,G_1,\dots,G_m$} 
    \State $\texttt{quotient} = 0$
    \State $\texttt{remainder} = 0$
    \Repeat
    \If{$\lt(G_i) \cdot a_i = \lt(F)$}
    \State $\texttt{quotient} \from \texttt{quotient} + a_i\cdot G_i$
    \State $F \from F - a_i\cdot G_i$
    \Else
    \State $\texttt{remainder} \from \texttt{remainder} + \lt(F)$
    \State $F\from F- \lt(F)$
    \EndIf
    \Until{$F = 0$}
    \Return\{\texttt{quotient}, \texttt{reminder}\}
    \EndProcedure
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

At the end of this algorithm, we can write
\[
F = \sum_{\mathrm{finite}}  a_i\cdot G_i + r.
\]
If the reminder is zero, then $F\in I$. However, this algorithm is
insufficient. Consider an example from \cite{hS2003} where
\begin{align*}
  F &= x^2 - y^2\\
  G_1 &= x^2 + y\\
  G_2 &=xy+x \\
  I &= (G_1,G_2).
\end{align*}
Let's run the division algorithm manually in \macaulay and try to see
if we what happens.

\begin{macaulay2}
R = ZZ/101[x,y];
F = x^2-y^2;
G1 = x^2+y;
G2 = x*y+x;
leadTerm F
leadTerm G1
F%G1
\end{macaulay2}

Using the monomial order \texttt{GRevLex}, $\lt(F) = x^2$ and
$\lt(G_1) = x^2$. Hence, we divide $F$ by $G_1$ and compute the
remainder, which comes out to $-y^2-y$. Since neither $\lt(G_1) =
x^2$ nor $\lt(G_2) = xy$ divide $y^2$, the algorithm concludes with
\[
F  = 1\cdot G_1 + \underbrace{-y^2-y}_{\text{remainder}}.
\]
this would seem to indicate that $F\notin I$. However,
\[
F = x G_1 - y G_2.
\]
so in fact, $F\in I$. Our algorithm didn't work because the lead terms
of $G_1$ and $G_2$ cancelled. To remedy this, we will enlarge our set
of generators to include more lead terms. This leads us to the
definition of a Gr\"obner basis.

\begin{definition}
  A subset $\{G_1,\dots, G_n\}\subset I$ of an ideal is a
  \dfn{Gr\"obner basis} for $I$ if
  \[
  \lt(I) = (\lt(G_1),\dots, \lt(G_n)).
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  Suppose $(G_1,\dots,G_n)$ is a Gr\"obner basis for $I$. Then
  \[
  I = (G_1,\dots,G_n).
  \]
  \begin{proof}
    Suppose $F\in I$. Using the division algorithm on the ideal
    $(G_1,\dots,G_n)$, there will always be a $G_i$ such that
    $\lt(G_i)|\lt(F)$. Hence $F$ can be expressed as a finite sum
    \[
    F = \sum_\mathrm{finite} a_i G_i.
    \]
  \end{proof}
\end{proposition}

Now suppose that $(G_1,\dots,G_n)$ is a Gr\"obner basis for some
ideal. We can then write:
\[
0 \to S \to k[\x]^n \to k[x]/I \to 0
\]
$S$ is a syzygy, the kernel of this map of free modules.

\begin{definition}
  Let $F,G\in k[\x]$ be nonzero polynomials. The \dfn{S-polynomial} or
  \dfn{syzygy-polynomial} is given by
  \[
  S(F,G) := \frac{\lcm(\lm(F),\lm(G))}{\lt(F)}\cdot F - \frac{\lcm(\lm(F),\lm(G))}{\lt(G)}\cdot G.
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{macaulay2}
Spair = (G1,G2) ->
lcm(leadMonomial(G1),leadMonomial(G2))/leadTerm(G1)*G1-
lcm(leadMonomial(G1),leadMonomial(G2))/leadTerm(G2)*G2;
\end{macaulay2}





\begin{theorem}[Buchberger's Criterion]
  A set $\{G_1,\dots,G_n\}\subset k[\x]$ is Gr\"obner basis if and
  only if for all $i\ne j$
  \[
  S(G_i,G_j) \equiv 0 \pmod{(\i g})
  \]
  where $\i g = (G_1,\dots,G_n)$. In this case $G_i$ and $G_j$ are
  called \dfn{S-pairs} or $\dfn{syzygy-pairs}$.
  \begin{proof}
    $(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose that $\{G_1,\dots,G_n\}$ is a Gr\"obner
    basis. Since $S(G_i,G_j)\in (G_1,\dots,G_n)$ we are done.

    $(\Leftarrow)$ Suppose that $F\in \i g$ and that
    \[
    S(G_i,G_j \equiv 0 \pmod{(\i g})
    \]
    for all $i\ne j$. We must show that
    \[
    \lt(F) \in (\lt(G_1),\dots, \lt(G_n)).
    \]
    Since $F\in \i g$, we know
    \[
    F = \sum_{\mathrm{finite}} a_i G_i
    \]
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}
