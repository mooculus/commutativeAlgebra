\section{The ideal membership problem}

Given a ring and ideal in the ring, we would like to know when an
element is a member of the ideal. We'll need some notation.


\begin{definition}
  Consider a polynomial $f\in k[x_1,\dots, x_n]$ with a monomial order
  $>$.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The \dfn{multidegree} of $f$ is
    \[
    \multideg(f) := \max\{\valpha: \text{$c_\valpha x^\valpha$ is the largest term w.r.t.\ $>$} \}.
    \]
  \item The \dfn{lead coefficient} of $f$ is $\lc(f) := c_{\multideg(f)}$.
  \item The \dfn{lead monomial} of $f$ is $\lm(f) := \x^{\multideg(f)}$.
  \item The \dfn{lead term} of $f$ is $\lt(f) := \lc(f)\cdot \lm(f)$.
  \item The \dfn{ideal of lead terms} of an ideal $I\subset k[\x]$ is
    the ideal
    \[
    \lt(I) = (\lt(f): f\in I)\subset k[\x].
    \]
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Now suppose we are working in the ring $k[x_1,\dots, x_n]$ and we have an ideal
\[
I = (g_1,\dots, g_m) \subset k[\x].
\]
Here is a basic algorithm that attempts to solve the ideal membership
problem.

\begin{algorithm}[Division algorithm]
  \hfill
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
    \Procedure{Division}{$f,g_1,\dots,g_m$} 
    \State $\texttt{quotient} = 0$
    \State $\texttt{remainder} = 0$
    \Repeat
    \If{$\lt(g_i) \cdot h_i = \lt(f)$}
    \State $\texttt{quotient} \from \texttt{quotient} + h_i\cdot g_i$
    \State $f \from f - h_i\cdot G_i$
    \Else
    \State $\texttt{remainder} \from \texttt{remainder} + \lt(f)$
    \State $f\from f- \lt(f)$
    \EndIf
    \Until{$f = 0$}
    \Return\{\texttt{quotient}, \texttt{reminder}\}
    \EndProcedure
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

At the end of this algorithm, we can write
\[
f = \sum_{\mathrm{finite}}  h_i\cdot g_i + r.
\]
If the reminder is zero, then $f\in I$. However, this algorithm is
insufficient. Consider an example from \cite{hS2003} where
\begin{align*}
  f &= x^2 - y^2\\
  g_1 &= x^2 + y\\
  g_2 &=xy+x \\
  I &= (g_1,g_2).
\end{align*}
Let's run the division algorithm manually in \macaulay and try to see
if we what happens.

\begin{macaulay2}
R = ZZ/101[x,y];
f = x^2-y^2;
g1 = x^2+y;
g2 = x*y+x;
leadTerm f
leadTerm g1
g%g1
\end{macaulay2}

Using the monomial order \texttt{GRevLex}, $\lt(f) = x^2$ and
$\lt(g_1) = x^2$. Hence, we divide $f$ by $g_1$ and compute the
remainder, which comes out to $-y^2-y$. Since neither $\lt(g_1) =
x^2$ nor $\lt(g_2) = xy$ divide $y^2$, the algorithm concludes with
\[
f  = 1\cdot g_1 + \underbrace{-y^2-y}_{\text{remainder}}.
\]
this would seem to indicate that $F\notin I$. However,
\[
f = x g_1 - y g_2.
\]
so in fact, $f\in I$. Our algorithm didn't work because the lead terms
of $g_1$ and $g_2$ cancelled. To remedy this, we will enlarge our set
of generators to include more lead terms. This leads us to the
definition of a Gr\"obner basis.

\begin{definition}
  A subset $\{g_1,\dots, g_n\}\subset I$ of an ideal is a
  \dfn{Gr\"obner basis} for $I$ if
  \[
  \lt(I) = (\lt(g_1),\dots, \lt(g_n)).
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  Suppose $(g_1,\dots,g_n)$ is a Gr\"obner basis for $I$. Then
  \[
  I = (g_1,\dots,g_n).
  \]
  \begin{proof}
    Suppose $f\in I$. Using the division algorithm on the ideal
    $(g_1,\dots,g_n)$, there will always be a $g_i$ such that
    $\lt(g_i)|\lt(f)$. Hence $f$ can be expressed as a finite sum
    \[
    f = \sum_\mathrm{finite} h_i g_i.
    \]
  \end{proof}
\end{proposition}

Now suppose that $(g_1,\dots,g_n)$ is a Gr\"obner basis for some
ideal. We can then write:
\[
0 \to S \to k[\x]^n \to k[x]/I \to 0
\]
$S$ is a syzygy, the kernel of this map of free modules.

\begin{definition}
  Let $f,g\in k[\x]$ be nonzero polynomials. The \dfn{S-polynomial} or
  \dfn{syzygy-polynomial} is given by
  \[
  S(f,g) := \frac{\lcm(\lm(f),\lm(g))}{\lt(f)}\cdot f - \frac{\lcm(\lm(f),\lm(g))}{\lt(g)}\cdot g.
  \]
\end{definition}

\begin{macaulay2}
Spair = (g1,g2) ->
lcm(leadMonomial(g1),leadMonomial(g2))/leadTerm(g1)*g1-
lcm(leadMonomial(g1),leadMonomial(g2))/leadTerm(g2)*g2;
R = ZZ/101[x,y];
g1 = x^2+y;
g2 = x*y+x;
Spair(g1,g2)
\end{macaulay2}





\begin{theorem}[Buchberger's Criterion]
  A set $\{g_1,\dots,g_n\}\subset k[\x]$ is Gr\"obner basis if and
  only if for all $i\ne j$
  \[
  S(g_i,g_j) \equiv 0 \pmod{\i g}
  \]
  where $\i g = (g_1,\dots,g_n)$. In this case $g_i$ and $g_j$ are
  called \dfn{S-pairs} or $\dfn{syzygy-pairs}$.
  \begin{proof}
    $(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose that $\{g_1,\dots,g_n\}$ is a Gr\"obner
    basis. Since $S(g_i,g_j)\in (g_1,\dots,g_n)$ we are done.

    $(\Leftarrow)$ Suppose that $f\in \i g$ and that
    \[
    S(g_i,g_j \equiv 0 \pmod{(\i g})
    \]
    for all $i\ne j$. We must show that
    \[
    \lt(f) \in (\lt(g_1),\dots, \lt(g_n)).
    \]
    Since $f\in \i g$, we know
    \[
    f = \sum_{\mathrm{finite}} h_i g_i.
    \]
    At this point there are two cases, either $\lm(f) = \lm(g_i)$, in
    which case we are done, or not. This second case is the one that
    requires attention. We refer the interested reader
    to~\ref{CLO2007}.
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}
