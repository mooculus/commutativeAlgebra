\section{The division algorithm}

Given a ring and ideal in the ring, we would like to know when an
element is a member of the ideal. We'll need some notation.


\begin{definition}
  Consider a polynomial $F\in k[x_1,\dots, x_n]$ with a monomial order
  $>$.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The \dfn{multidegree} of $F$ is
    \[
    \multideg(F) := \max\{\valpha: \text{$c_\valpha x^\valpha$ is the largest term w.r.t.\ $>$} \}
    \]
  \item The \dfn{lead coefficient} of $F$ is $\lc(F) := c_{\multideg(F)}$.
  \item The \dfn{lead monomial} of $F$ is $\lm(F) := \x^{\multideg(F)}$.
  \item The \dfn{lead term} of $F$ is $\lt(F) := \lc(F)\cdot \lm(F)$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Now suppose we are working in the ring $k[x_1,\dots, x_n]$ and we have an ideal
\[
I = (G_1,\dots, G_m) \subset k[\x]
\]
