Recall the definition of a topological space:

\begin{definition}
  A \dfn{topological space} is a set $X$ with a subset called the
  \dfn{closed sets} that satisfy the following properties:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The empty set and $X$ are closed.
  \item Intersections of arbitrary collections of closed sets are
    closed.
  \item Finite unions of closed sets are closed.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
  A topological space $X$ is said to be \dfn{irreducible} if $X\ne
  \emptyset$ and if given closed sets $X_1$ and $X_2$, $X=X_1\cup X_2$
  implies $X=X_1$ or $X=X_2$.
\end{definition}




\begin{definition}
  Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces. A function $f:X\to Y$ is
  called \dfn{continuous} if for each closed set in $V \subset Y$,
  $f^{-1}(V)$ is closed in $X$.
\end{definition}



\begin{definition}
  Let $X$ and $Y$ be topological spaces. A function $f:X\to Y$ is a
  \dfn{homeomorphism} if:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $f$ is bijective.
  \item $f$ is continuous.
  \item $f^{-1}$ is continuous.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
