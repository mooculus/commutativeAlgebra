\maketitle


At this point we should believe there is a correspondence between:
affine algebraic varieties and ideals; and affine space and the prime
spectrum. Let's make this precise. We start by proving Noether
normalization. We will prove it now for infinite fields. Later we will
give a general proof. See \cite{iK1966,gK2011,eK1991} for alternate
proofs at this level.


\begin{proposition}\label{P:finiteext}
  Let $R$ be a ring, $R[X]/(f)$ is a finitely generated module over
  $R$ if $f$ is a monic polynomial.
  \begin{proof}
    If $f(X) = X^n + a_{n-1}X^{n-1} + \dots + a_1 X + a_0$, then
    \[
    X^n = -a_{n-1}X^{n-1} - \dots - a_1 X - a_0
    \]
    in $R[X]/(f)$. So, $R[X]/(f)$ is generated by
    $\{1,X,\dots,X^{n-1}\}$.
  \end{proof}
\end{proposition}


\begin{theorem}[Noether normalization]
  Let $k$ be an infinite field and $A$ be a finitely generated
  $k$-algebra. There exist $\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_m\in A$ such that
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\alpha_i$ are algebraically independent over $k$.
  \item $A$ is module-finite over $k[\boldsymbol{\alpha}]$.
  \end{enumerate}
  In other words, 
  \[
  k\subset k[\boldsymbol{\alpha}] \subset A,
  \]
  where $k[\boldsymbol{\alpha}]$ is a polynomial ring over $k$, and
  $A$ is a finitely generated as a $k[\boldsymbol{\alpha}]$-module.
  \begin{sketch}
    Proceed by induction on the number of generators
    $\zeta_1,\dots,\zeta_n$ of $A$ as a $k$-algebra. Consider
    \[
    k \subset B \subset k[\zeta] = A
    \]
    Decided what $B$ must be when $\zeta$ is algebraic over $k$, and
    when $\zeta$ is transcendental over $k$.

    Now suppose that we know this theorem for $A$ generated by up to
    $n$ generators. We need to show this holds for $n$ generators.

    Consider the canonical map
    \[
    k[\X] \to k[\boldsymbol{\zeta}]
    \]


    (More will be given later)
  \end{sketch}
\end{theorem}

Let's see an example in \macaulay. Below, we will set $k = \Q$ and $A
= \Q[x]/(xy+yz^2,x^2y-xz^3)$.

\begin{macaulay2}
loadPackage "NoetherNormalization"
setRandomSeed(42);
R = QQ[x,y,z,MonomialOrder=>Lex];
I = ideal(x*y+y*z^2,x^2*y-x*z^3);
A = R/I;
(phi,J,X)=noetherNormalization(A)
phi(lift(x,R))
phi(lift(y,R))
phi(lift(z,R))
transpose gens gb J
\end{macaulay2}

Now we have $I = (xy+yz^2,x^2y-xz^3)$, and
$A=\Q[x,y,z]/I$. \macaulay\ gives a map of rings $\phi$ and the image
of $I$ under $\phi$, we'll call it $J$. We now have
\[
A=\Q[x,y,z]/I  \iso \Q[4x+y+z,x,y]/J.
\]
From our final computation, we witness a monic polynomial generating
$y$ over $\Q[z]$, namely $y^7+y^6z-3y^6-2y^5z+y^4z^2$, and a polynomial
with an invertible lead coefficient generating $x$ over $\Q[y,z]$,
namely $4x^2+xy^2+xy+xz$. Hence 
\[
\Q \subset \Q[z] \subset \Q[4x+y+z,x,y]/J
\]
where the first extension is a polynomial extension and the second is
module finite.




Now we prove the so-called ``weak nullstellensatz.'' Again we will
insist that the field be infinite so that we can apply the version of
Noether normalization above. Later, when we prove Noether
normalization in generality, a more general version of the weak
nullstellensatz will also hold.

\begin{theorem}[Weak nullstellensatz]
  Let $k$ be a(n infinite) field, and $L$ be a $k$-algebra such that
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $L$ is finitely generated as a $k$-algebra.
  \item $L$ is a field.
  \end{enumerate}
  In this case, $L$ is an algebraic extension of $k$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
  Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. An ideal $I$ is maximal in
  $k[\X]$ if and only if $I= (X_1-a_1,\dots,X_n-a_n)$ for some $a_i\in
  k$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{sketch}


The evalutaion map is a surjective homomorphism to k. So, $I$ is maximal. For the other direction, if $I$ is maximal then $k[\X] / I$ is a field and by Weak nullstellansatz it is an algebraic extension of k where k is an algebraically closed field.Therefore, $k[\X] / I = k$


\end{sketch}



\begin{theorem}[Nullstellensatz]
  Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field with $I \subsetneq k[X_1,\dots,X_n]$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\V(I) \ne \emptyset$.
  \item $\I(\V(I)) = \rad{I}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

\begin{sketch}
Assume k is an algebraically closed field and $I$ is a proper ideal.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $I$ is contained in a maximal ideal. Use the Corollary above to finish.
    \item Say $I=(f_1,...,f_m)$ and $f \in \I(\V(I))$. Introduce a new variable $Y$ and consider the ideal $J=(f_1,...,f_m, fY-1)$. Observe that $V(J)$ is empty and conclude from part (a) that $J=k[X_1,...,X_n,Y]$. Write $1=\sum_{i=1}^m f_i g_i + (fY-1) h$. Working in the field of fractions, put $Y=\frac{1}{f}$. Clear denominators to get $f^n \in I$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{sketch}


\begin{corollary}
  Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field and $\vec{F} =
  F_1,\dots,F_n\in k[x]$. In this case,
  \[
  \vec{F}(\x) \ne 0
  \]
  for all $\x\in\k^m$ if and only if there exist $G_i\in k[\X]$ such that
  \[
  1 = \sum_{i=1}^m G_i F_i.
  \]
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}
  Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field and $A$ be a $k$-algebra.
  In this case,
  \[
  A = k[\X]/\I(V) 
  \]
  if and only if $\rad{0_A} = (0)$ and $A$ is finitely generated as a
  $k$-algebra.
\end{corollary}


\begin{corollary}
  Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field and $V\subset\A^n$. An ideal $I$ is maximal in
  $k[\X]/\I(V)$ if and only if $I= (X_1-a_1,\dots,X_n-a_n)$ for some $a_i\in
  k$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{corollary}
  The category of affine algebraic varieties and morphisms is
  equivalent to the category of $k$-algebras of the form
  $k[\X]/\rad{I}$ and $k$-algebra homomorphisms with the arrows
  reversed.
\end{corollary}
