\title{Fundamental theorems}

\begin{document}
\begin{abstract}
  We review several fundamental theorems, all of which are special cases of primary decomposition.

\section{The fundamental theorem of arithmetic}

\begin{theorem}
  Every integer greater than $1$ can be factored uniquely (up to
  ordering) into primes.
\end{theorem}

Of course, you've now seen this in more generality.

\begin{theorem}
  Let $R$ be a euclidean domain\dots
\end{theorem}


\section{The fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups}

\begin{theorem}
  Every finitely generated abelian group $G$ is isomorphic to a
  direct sum of cyclic groups of prime-power order and infinite cyclic
  groups,
  \[
  G \iso \Z^n \dsum \directsum_{i=1}^{m} \Z_{p_i^{k_i}},
  \]
  where the $p_i$ are not necessarily distinct prime numbers.
\end{theorem}


Structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a PID
