We begin with another example of Eisenbud's phrase: ``ideals maximal
with respect to some property have an uncanny tendency to be prime.''


\begin{proposition}
  Let $R\subset S$ be rings and let $\p\in\spec(R)$. Consider the set
  \[
  \mathcal{S} = \{I\subset S: \text{$I$ is an ideal of $S$ and $(R-\p)\cap I = \emptyset$}\}.
  \]
  If $S$ has a maximal element $P$, then $P\in\spec(S)$.
  \begin{proof}
    Let $P$ be a maximal element of $\mathcal{S}$. Seeking a
    contradiction, suppose that $xy\in P$ but $x\notin P$ and $y\notin
    P$. This means that $x\in R-\p$ and $y\in R-\p$, but this means
    that $xy\in R-\p$, a contradiction. Hence $P\in\spec(S)$.
  \end{proof}
\end{proposition}

\begin{exercise}
  If $R\subset S$ and $P\in\spec(S)$, show that $P\cap R\in\spec(R)$.
\end{exercise}


\begin{proposition}
  Let $R\subset S$ be rings and $\p\in\spec(R)$. The ring $S$ has the
  going-up property over $R$ if and only if $P\in\spec(S)$ is maximal in
  \[
  \mathcal{S} = \{I\subset S: \text{$I$ is an ideal of $S$ and
    $(R-\p)\cap I = \emptyset$}\}
  \]
  implies that $P\cap R = \p$.
  \begin{proof}
    $(\Rightarrow)$ Suppose $P\in\spec{S}$ is maximal in
    $\mathcal{S}$. We must show that the going-up property holds for
    $\p$.

    First note that $P\cap R\in\spec(R)$. Note, by the construction of
    $P$, $P\cap R$ cannot properly contain $\p$. Hence if $P\cap
    R\subset \p$, then enlarge $P\cap R$ to $\p$. By going-up, there
    exists $P'\in\spec(S)$ with $P'\cap R = \p$. Since $P$ is maximal
    in $\mathcal{S}$, we gave that $P=P'$.

    $(\Leftarrow)$ Suppose that $\p'\subset\p\in\spec(R)$ and that
    $P'\in\spec(S)$ with $P'\cap R = \p'$. Note, $P'\in\mathcal{S}$,
    taking the maximal element $P\in\mathcal{S}$, we have that $P\cap
    R = \p$. Hence $R\subset S$ has the going up property.
  \end{proof}
\end{proposition}


\begin{corollary}
  If a pair of rings $R\subset S$ has the going-up property, then they
  have the lying-over property.
  \begin{proof}
    We can always find a maximal element of sets like $\mathcal{S}$,
    so by our work above, going-up implies lying-over.
  \end{proof}
\end{corollary}


\begin{proposition}
  Let $R\subset S$ be rings and $\p\in\spec(R)$. The ring $S$ is
  incomparable over $R$ if and only if $P\in\spec(S)$ $P\cap R =\p$
  implies $P$ is maximal in
  \[
  \mathcal{S} = \{I\subset S: \text{$I$ is an ideal of $S$ and
    $(R-\p)\cap I = \emptyset$}\}.
  \]
\end{proposition}


\begin{theorem}
  Let $R\subset S$ be rings with $S$ integral over $R$. In this case,
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The pair $R\subset S$ has the lying-over property.
  \item The pair $R\subset S$ has the incomparable property.
  \item The pair $R\subset S$ has the going-up-property.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
