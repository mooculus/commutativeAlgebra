\section{UFD's are integrally closed}

\begin{theorem}
  Let $A$ be a UFD, then $A = \tilde{A}$.
  \begin{proof}
    Let $\alpha \in \ff(A)$ with $\alpha = a/b$ and $a,b\in A$ where
    $a$ and $b$ have no common factors.  We must show that if there is
    an integral relation for $\alpha$, then $\alpha\in A$. For $c_i\in
    A$, suppose we have
    \begin{align*}
      \alpha^n + c_{n-1} \alpha^{n-1}+ \dots + c_1 \alpha + c_0 &= 0 \\
      (a/b)^n + c_{n-1} (a/b)^{n-1}+ \dots + c_1 (a/b) + c_0 &= 0 \\
      a^n + c_{n-1} a^{n-1}b+ \dots + c_1 ab^{n-1} + c_0b^n &= 0
    \end{align*}
    but this implies that $b|a$, implying that $b$ is a unit in $A$,
    and hence $\alpha = a/b\in A$.
  \end{proof}
\end{theorem}


The word ``normal'' is synomonous with ``integrally closed'' in algebra and algebraic geometry.

\begin{definition}
  A \dfn{normal domain} is an integrally closed domain.
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}
  $\Z$ is normal, and so is $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ where $k$ is a field.
\end{corollary}


\begin{definition}
  A \dfn{discrete valuation ring} also known as a \dfn{DVR} is a local
  PID.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
  $\Z_{(p)}$, $k[X]_{(X)}$, and $k\lps X\rps$ are discrete valuation
  rings.
\end{example}


In this text, we require local rings to be Noetherian.


\begin{proposition}
  Let $(A,\m)$ be a local domain. The following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $A$ is a discrete valuation ring.
  \item $A$ is a normal domain and $\h(\p)= 1$ for all nonzero prime
    ideals in $\spec(A)$.
  \item $A$ is a normal domain and the exists nonzero $m\in \m$ such
    that $\m\in\ass(A/m A)$.
  \item The ideal $\m$ is principal and nonzero.
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{proof}
    (a)$\Rightarrow$(b) If $A$ is a DVR, then it is a PDF, hence it is
    a UFD, and it is integrally closed.  Since $A$ is local $\h(\m) =
    1$.

    (b)$\Rightarrow$(c) Consider nonzero $m\in \m$, so we have
    $\m\in\ass(A/m A)$.

    (c)$\Rightarrow$(d) Since $\m\in\ass(A/m A)$ there is an injection
    \[
    A/\m \into A/m A
    \]
    Let $\bar{x}$ be the image of $1$ under this map. In this case,
    \[
    x\in A \quad\text{but}\quad x\notin m A.
    \]
    On the other hand, $\m x \subset m A$. Hence $\m x m^{-1} \subset
    A$. Note, $xm^{-1}\notin A$, otherwise, $x\in mA$. Now we claim
    that $xm^{-1}\notin\m$. If this were the case, then since $\m$ is
    finitely generated, $xm^{-1}$ would be integral over $A$, which is
    not the case since $A = \tilde{A}$.

    So, since $\m x m^{-1} \subset A$, there must be $u = axm^{-1}$
    invertible in $\m$. 
     
  \end{proof}
\end{proposition}







\section{Lying-over}

Let's witness lying-over with \macaulay.  Consider $R=\Q[x,y]$ and the
ideal $(x)\subset \Q[x,y]$, and $S = \Q[x,y,z]/(z^2 -xz -1)$. Note,
this is an integral extension.

We can use the \macaulay\ command \texttt{minimalPrimes} to find the
minimal elements of $\ass_S(R/xR)$. These will be the primes lying
over $(x)$ in $\spec(S)$.
\begin{macaulay2}
S = QQ[x,y,z]/(z^2-x*z-1);
minimalPrimes ideal x
\end{macaulay2}

From this code, we see that primes $(z-1,x)\subset S$ and
$(z+1,x)\subset S$ are the primes lying over $(x)$.


\begin{macaulay2}
S =ZZ/101[x,y]/(y^2-x^2)
minimalPrimes ideal (0_S)


restart
S =ZZ/101[x,y]/(x*y-1)
minimalPrimes ideal (x-1)
\end{macaulay2}
