The going-down property also is closely related to integral
extensions. To start, we will strengthen Proposition~\ref{P:localint}.


\begin{proposition}[Integral closure and localization]
  Let $R\subset S$ with $A$ being the integral closure of $R$
  in $S$. If $U\subset R$ is a multiplicatively closed set, then
  $U^{-1}\tilde{R}$ is the integral closure of $U^{-1}R$ in $U^{-1}S$.
  \begin{proof}
  \end{proof}
\end{proposition}


\begin{definition}
  Let $A$ be a domain. The \dfn{integral closure} of $A$, without
  reference to another ring, means the integral closure of $A$ in its
  field of fractions $\ff(A)$. In this case we write $\tilde{A}$ for
  the integral closure.
\end{definition}



\begin{proposition}
  Let $A$ be an integral domain, the following are equivalent:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $A$ is integrally closed.
  \item $A_\p$ is integrally closed for all $\p\in\spec(A)$.
  \item $A_\m$ is integrally closed for all maximal ideals.
  \end{enumerate}
  \begin{proof}
  \end{proof}
\end{proposition}


\begin{definition}
   Let $R\subset S$ with $I\subset R$ an ideal. The integral closure
   of $I$ in $S$ is the subset of $S$ consisting of integral elements of

   integral equation with coefficients in $I$.
\end{definition}


\begin{proposition}
  Let $A$ be the integral closure of $R$ in $S$. Let $I$ be an ideal
  of $R$. Then $\rad{IA}S$ is the integral closure of $I$  in $S$  
\end{proposition}


\begin{proposition}
\end{proposition}


\begin{theorem}[Going-down]
  If $A\subset B$ are integral domains, $A$ is integrally closed in
  its field of fractions, and $B$ is integrally closed, then the
  going-down property holds.
\end{theorem}
